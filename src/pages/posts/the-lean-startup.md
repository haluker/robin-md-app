### Personal Review

 

It took me around a month to complete this book as I was reading at a slow pace. Book is more of a technical handbook to know how to identify the best things we can do with our product. I found some key questions answered by this book

* How to create a product?
* How to know if the product is working?
* How to scale the product?

The book relates to multiple examples like Apple, Facebook, Intuit, etc. to define a process and product creation. The book shows product creation either by a startup or a big company goes through a similar process. Big companies although have financial leverage itâ€™s not enough to define the success of the product. The success of any product is determined by the customers. Sometimes simple features can be more impactful to customers than sophisticated or advanced features. It all depends on how quickly we can find and implement those features for our product.

Listing all the good things presented in the book is impossible to present here in this short article. I felt the book is worth reading.

This Book can also be used as a guide to help you get out of some problems that you might be facing in ongoing business or product development.
